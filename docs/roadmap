Planned features

Version 0.4 should include
	A value heap to handle allocation of values which could significantly speed up execution. [DONE]
	Automatic typing variables. auto a := blah [DONE]
	
Version 0.5 should include
	Memory profiling. [Largely done, fixed all runtime memory leaks. There is one nasty one left in the parser]
	Changes to parser interface. [DONE]
	Change function definition from f(var a : int) to f(a:int) [DONE]
	Threading support [DONE]
	Support for arrays. [Almost done. Need := to nil]
	Improved type support at runtime ( Implementing many operations or providing compile time checks for operations that should never be implemented ) [ Types are now much more complex. Improvement work should be carried over to next release]

Version 0.6 should include
	Support for function references
	Support for channels
	Floats
	Support for user defined structures

Version 0.7 should include
	Compiled dynamic library linking support.
	For example a .so or .dll file could be distributed with a binary which would
	provide the runtime sys namespace.

Version 0.8
	Better debugging information for the programmer.
