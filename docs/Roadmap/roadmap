	Automatic typing variables. auto a := blah [DONE]
	
Version 0.5 should include

	Change function definition from f(var a : int) to f(a:int) [DONE]
	Threading support [DONE]
	Support for arrays. [Almost done. Need := to nil]
	Improved type support at runtime ( Implementing many operations or providing compile time checks for operations that should never be implemented ) [ Types are now much more complex. Improvement work should be carried over to next release]

	Support for channels [ CANCELLED ]
	Floats [ DONE ]
