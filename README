To compile Scribble bison, flex and a C++11 compatable version of the program g++ must be installed and in the path. ( So typing bison, flex and g++ on the command line must execute those programs )

If using a version of these which has not been installed to your path by default you can add it to the path by typing export PATH=$PATH:Path/To/Tool/Directory on Linux and other UNIX systems

The program should compile on windows however it is untested and Linux is recommended.

To compile the program run the program make when inside the Scribble directory. For example if the Scribble directory was ~/Scribble then you would type 
"cd ~/Scribble && make" this will place the generated executable in ~/Scribble/bin/ 

Scribble has three possible command line parameters. 
--file Path executes the file at the specified path.
--exec Code overrides the default function to run with a specific piece of Scribble code
--mode Allows you to select whether you want the program to be executed inside the VM or by walking the statement tree or both by using "vm", "tree" or "all" as an argument

To run the Scribble test program ( Which tests the core portions of the language and some sorts ) when the Scribble directory is the current directory type
"./bin/scribble --file examples/executeTests.sc --mode all"

You should see some output like 

"Scribble 0.5.4078
VM execution took time 0.307441"

This will execute the Scribble file located at examples/executeTests.sc

Another provided example execution would is the sorts example which executes a quick sort on a worst case array of integers, printing the list before and after the sort.
It is executed using the command "./bin/scribble --file examples/sorts_example.sc" and should produce output similar to

"Scribble 0.5.4078
Worst Case: 100 99 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 91 90 89 88 87 86 85 84 83 82 81 80 79 78 77 76 75 74 73 72 71 70 69 68 67 66 65 64 63 62 61 60 59 58 57 56 55 54 53 52 51 50 49 48 47 46 45 44 43 42 41 40 39 38 37 36 35 34 33 32 31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 

After Sorting: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 
VM execution took time 0.016461"

The third provided example is

./bin/scribble --file examples/import_example.sc 

Which uses imports and the system library to produce the following output.

Scribble 0.5.4078
Hello thar world
Hello thar bud
VM execution took time 0.000000
