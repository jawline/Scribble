To compile Scribble bison, flex and a C++11 compatable version of the program g++ must be installed and in the path. ( So typing bison, flex and g++ on the command line must execute those programs )

If using a version of these which has not been installed to your path by default you can add it to the path by typing export PATH=$PATH:Path/To/Tool/Directory on Linux and other UNIX systems

The program should compile on windows however it is untested and Linux is recommended.

To compile the program run the program make when inside the Scribble directory. For example if the Scribble directory was ~/Scribble then you would type 
"cd ~/Scribble && make" this will place the generated executable in ~/Scribble/bin/

To install Scribble to /usr/bin type make install with elevated privileges (E.g. sudo make install)

Usage: ./bin/scribble [OPTIONS] file
Options:
-v --version: version information
-r --runtime: output the time it takes for a script to execute
